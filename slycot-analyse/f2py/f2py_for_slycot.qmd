# F2PY for slycot

## Fortran 77

### Scalar Example

```fortran
C FILE: SCALAR.F
      SUBROUTINE FOO(A,B)
         REAL*8 A
         REAL*8 B

         PRINT*, "BEFORE INCREMENT"
         PRINT*, "     A=",A," B=",B
         PRINT*, "INCREMENT A AND B"
         A = A + 1D0
         B = B - 1D0
         PRINT*, "NEW  A=",A," B=",B
      END
C END OF FILE SCALAR.F
```

```fortran
PROGRAM MAIN
    REAL*8 :: A
    REAL*8 :: B
    A = 1D0
    B = 2D0
    CALL FOO(A,B)
    PRINT*, "MAIN A=",A," B=",B
END
```

! Note: the context of this file is case sensitive.

python module scalar0 ! in 
    interface  ! in :scalar0
        subroutine foo(a,b) ! in :scalar0:scalar.f
            real*8 :: a
            real*8 :: b
        end subroutine foo
    end interface 
end python module scalar0
